## Part 1: Directions on Using WebStorm
[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed by JetBrains for coding in JavaScript, as well as other web development languages, such as HTML and CSS.
1. Apply for a WebStorm license and download the software [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/). They provide free licenses to students upon identification.
2. Install **Git** locally on your device [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Register for a **Github** account [here](https://github.com/join).
4. Next, we can set up Git with Webstorm, allowing you to **push** content from your local **repository** to a remote **repository** on **Github**. In Webstorm, perform Ctrl+Alt+S to access the Settings.
5. From here go to Version Control > Git, and locate your Git executable path. Enter this information in the "Path to Git executable" box.
