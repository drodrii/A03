# A03: Git/Webstorm/Github/Tutorial
## Part 1: Directions on Using WebStorm
[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed by JetBrains for coding in JavaScript, as well as other web development languages, such as HTML and CSS.

### Setting up Webstorm, Git, and Github
1. Apply for a WebStorm license and download the software [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/). They provide free licenses to students upon identification.
2. Install **Git** locally on your device [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Register for a **Github** account [here](https://github.com/join).
4. Next, we can set up Git with Webstorm, allowing you to **push** content from your local **repository** to a remote **repository** on **Github**. In Webstorm, perform Ctrl+Alt+S to access the Settings.
6. From here, go to Version Control > Git, and locate your Git executable path. Enter this information in the "Path to Git executable" box.

### Linking your Github to Webstorm
1. In Webstorm, perform Ctrl+Alt+S to access the Settings.
2. From here, go to Version Control > **Github**.
3. Select "+" and select "Log in via **Github**".
4. A browser window should open asking you to sign into your **Github** account, which will automatically link the account to your Webstorm application.

### Open a repository from Github in Webstorm
1. In Webstorm, select File > New > Project.
2. Choose "Empty Project" from the dropdown menu.
3. From the top toolbar, select "VCS" (Version Control System) > Get From Version Control
4. From here, you can either paste the URL of the repository you want to link to Webstorm, or select your Github account on the left side and choose the repository from there.
